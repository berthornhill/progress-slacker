# Progress Slacker

Whether its the grueling pace of the curriculum, the terrifying exams, fear of falling behind, the lack of sleep, or the culmination of all these elements and more, app Academy, as well as success therein, is mountain for anyone to climb. To succeed requires an immense amount of hard work, self discipline, perseverance, collective support from the community at hand and, perhaps the most import component of all, humor.

Enter projectSlacker. The *unofficially-official*Â© meme-generator designed to compliment and enhance the core app/Academy suite of educational tools and resources.

progressSlacker is a space for all past, present, and future app/Academy cohorts to share in the 'lols' by providing users with an easy-to-use interface in which they can select image templates, or upload their own, and add text or captions. progressSlacker will compile the image along with the added text, post it to a central feed as well as return a copy to the user for download. The handful of steps involved in this process present a series of challenges for us as the developers, including but image and data-size management, image compiling and rendering from user inputs, error management and processing the outputs, as well as many more.
